_This essay was written for the "Bitcoin Bounties" during the [Des Femmes 2022 Mentorship Program](https://desfemmesmagazine.com/blogs/latest-updates/mentorship-program)_

In this essay I would like to tell about my experience in taking the first steps in learning how to contribute to Open-Source software in the Bitcoin Space, more precisely: the Lightning Network.

The Lightning Network is a second-layer technology, which brings scalability and many more functionalities to the Bitcoin space. Like Bitcoin Core, it is also an open protocol, which is defined by so-called **BOLT**s (Basis of Lightning Technology). An overview of existing BOLTs can be found [here](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/00-introduction.md).

There are [several implementations](https://medium.com/@fulgur.ventures/an-overview-of-lightning-network-implementations-d670255a6cfa) of the protocol available, but in this essay I will focus on [Core Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning) (or just c-lightning) by Blockstream.
I will setup a Development Environment and use the Test-Suite [lnprototest](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest) to test the Core-Lightning implementation against the specifications defined in BOLTs and describe my learning experience during this process.

## Preparations

For a complete Development Environment and in order to be able to execute the tests, I needed to install/compile the following software:

- [Bitcoin Core](https://github.com/bitcoin/bitcoin)
- [Core Lightning](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/INSTALL.md)
- [lnprototest](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest)

The installation and build instructions can be found inside the linked GitHub repositories of the projects. I highly recommend following these instructions carefully.
It is also important to enable all the developer functionalities of c-lightning, so we have to compile it from source with the `--enable-developer` flag. I was compiling version v0.11.2.

## Execute the tests

After setting everything up, I was running the tests inside the root directory of `lnprototest`.
The tests will be executed against a running instance of Bitcoin Core and c-lightning in regtest network. The Test-Runner will also start the binaries `bitcoind` and `lightningd` automatically, so all I had to do is:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="shell">
  {`

`}

While inspecting the output, we can see that the test runner was looking for all Python scripts in the folder `test`, which filenames start with `test_` and all test cases were executed (have a look [here](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest#running-test) to learn more about how this works).\
During the further exploration of the test suite I also tried to run just a single test case. This speeds up the development process, because I don't want and have to run all the tests every time.

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
  {`
    (lnprototest-py3.10) $ pytest --runner=lnprototest.clightning.Runner tests/test_bolt1-01-init.py::test_init
  `}
</SyntaxHighlighter>

## Add new tests

Now letÂ´s take that a step further and imagine we are proposing an improvement to [BOLT #2 (Peer Protocol for Channel Management)](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/02-peer-protocol.md).
The process on how to add new test cases is described in detail [here](https://github.com/rustyrussell/lnprototest/blob/master/HACKING.md).
I created a new file inside the `test` folder called `test_bolt2-40-supercoolnewfeature.py` and added the first test case:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="python">
  {`
from lnprototest import (
    Runner,
    TryAll,
    Connect,
    ExpectMsg,
    Msg,
)
from typing import Any

def test_init(runner: Runner, namespaceoverride: Any) -> None:
test = [
Connect(connprivkey="02"),
ExpectMsg("init"),
TryAll(
Msg("implementme", globalfeatures="", features=""),
)
]
runner.run(test)
`}

</SyntaxHighlighter>

After I executed the test I received the following output:

<SyntaxHighlighter language="shell">
{`
(lnprototest-py3.10) $ pytest --runner=lnprototest.clightning.Runner tests/test_bolt2-40-supercoolnewfeature.py

            TryAll(

            )
        ]

    def __init__(
        self,
        msgtypename: str,
        connprivkey: Optional[str] = None,
        **kwargs: Union[ResolvableStr, ResolvableInt],
    ):
        super().__init__(connprivkey)
        self.msgtype = namespace().get_msgtype(msgtypename)

        if not self.msgtype:

>           raise SpecFileError(self, "Unknown msgtype {}".format(msgtypename))
>
> E lnprototest.errors.SpecFileError: (<lnprototest.event.Msg object at 0x7fac2b13a260>, 'Unknown msgtype implementme')

============================================================================================ 1 failed in 0.14s ============================================================================================
`}

</SyntaxHighlighter>

Of course the test failed, because the new feature is not implemented in c-lightning yet.
In the "short test summary info" section we can see the error message `Unknown msgtype implementme`, which indicates that we have to implement this message type first.

## Summary

This exercise was a great experience in start getting to learn how it would be to be actively contributing to the Lightning Network. There is a lot of material available to learn more on how Open-Source Development in the Bitcoin Space works, but I think the best way is always to get your hands dirty and really start building things.\
After all the steps I did while working with the Test Suite, I have more clarity now about what my next steps in the development process would be:

1. Think about what the "super cool new feature" could be :grin:
2. Create a Pull Request of the [BOLT Repository](https://github.com/lightning/bolts) and describe my feature inside the affected BOLT
3. Hopefully a great technical discussion will start on GitHub - improve the spec. and try to get a consensus about the proposed changes!
4. Create a fork the Repository of Core Lightning
5. Start implementing the new feature and also add good unit-tests to cover all the new code
6. Compile Core Lightning again
7. Add new tests to the Test-Suite to cover all the new functionality as specified in the updated BOLT

### Recommendations to other Developers

As I stated above, it was a great experience for me to do this exercise and I can highly recommend to do it by yourself.
From my experience I would also give the following recommendations to other "Junior Developers":

- Get a Development Environment up and running on your machine
- Use the CLI of c-lightning and Bitcoin Core to get familiar in working with it
- Start reading the BOLTs and learn how the Lightning Network works
- Also read [Mastering the Lightning Network](https://github.com/lnbook/lnbook) to learn from the experts
