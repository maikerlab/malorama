  This is a blog post about <strong>MDX</strong>. <br />
  We'll learn what MDX is and how to use it for creating a blog.

### Headings

Just use "hashtags" (e. g. `###`) to add (sub-)headings in your blog post like in normal markdown files.

### Syntax Highlighting

We can show code snippets by using the `SyntaxHighlighter` component.

<div>
  <CodeHighlight
    language="javascript"
    codeString={`
    const doStuff = () => {
      return console.log('hey')
    }
  `}
  />
</div>

<CodeHighlight
  language="kotlin"
  codeString={`
    fun getMenu() {
        val menus = await http.get('localhost:8080')
        if(menus.isEmpty) {
            throw NotFoundException("No menus were found")
        }
        for(val menu in menus) {
            when(menu.day) {
                "Monday" -> Toast.makeText(activity, "It's the start of the week!", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show()
                else -> {}
            }
    }
  `}
/>

We can also use simple code blocks by including code between 3 quotation marks.

```
  // this is a code block
  const doSomething = () => {
    return console.log('hey')
  }
```

### Using React components

I have created a component named "Expandable", where I used a [Disclosure element from Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/react/disclosure) and styled it to fit my needs.
Now I can use it inside my MDX files like this:

`<Expandable title="Hello" content="World" />`

<Expandable title="Hello" content="World" />
